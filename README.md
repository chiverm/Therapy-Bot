# DeepTalk

DeepTalk is an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to provide therapeutic support and guidance. The chatbot leverages a large language model (LLM) via an API to generate intelligent, empathetic, and context-aware responses.

Note: The underlying LLM technology is configurable and can be integrated with any supported API, allowing flexibility in choosing the conversational engine.
